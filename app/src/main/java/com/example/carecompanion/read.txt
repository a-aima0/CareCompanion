07/07/2024

tasks completed today:
- added phone authentication using a OTP
- user puts in phone number, OTP sends, and can verify

problems encountered and fixes:
- tried to use an android alert message but decided that an activity would be better
- there are only three alert buttons for an alert dialogue (positive, neutral and negative)
- this function required more than that.

current problems:
- the user can register with the OTP which should not be allowed
- the user should only be able to login with OTP if they alr have an account made
- e.g. create an account, then login with OTP using phone number

future steps:
- put phone number into the database as a feature of each user
- implement firestore into the otp feature
- make it so either email or phone number can be used to login in once the initial account is made
- adding a loading dialogue
- toast message telling the user the timeout count for them to hit "resend OTP".

tasks completed today:
- changed the entire program to include phone number as a user field including in authentication and firestore

problems encountered and fixes:
- kept getting error: object not at location
- found the error was due to incorrect profile image handling
- changed the code in editprofileactivity and profileactivity
- app now has a placeholder image until the user decided to add their own image

current problems:
- the user can register with the OTP which should not be allowed
- the user should only be able to login with OTP if they alr have an account made
- e.g. create an account, then login with OTP using phone number
- can possibly be fixed by implementing firestore into the OTP feature

future steps:
- make it so either email or phone number can be used to login in once the initial account is made
- adding a loading dialogue
- toast message telling the user the timeout count for them to hit "resend OTP".
- include countrycode in the register page
- google mail authentication a and sign in
